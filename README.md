# PS_Script_UserPW_Change
This Script was created in a successful attempt to force a huge amount of Active Directory accounts to change their passwort at the next login  


As this is my first Powershell Script please have mercy if any procedures were unclean or overcomplicated as the main aspect responsible to measure the scripts success was , having it purpose work.
